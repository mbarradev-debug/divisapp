## What Is Not Included

The following features are intentionally not part of this release:

- **User accounts**: No login or personalization features
- **Saved conversions**: Conversion history is not stored
- **Notifications**: No alerts for indicator value changes
- **Historical charts**: Values shown as lists, not graphs
- **Date range selection**: Fixed to last 10 values
- **Multiple languages**: Interface is in Spanish only
- **Offline support**: Requires internet connection

These features may be considered for future versions based on user feedback.

## Stability Notes

This is a stable release suitable for production use:

- All API calls include error handling
- Invalid routes show a proper 404 page
- Network failures display user-friendly error messages
- Form inputs are validated before submission
- The application has been tested across major browsers

### Known Limitations

1. **API Dependency**: The application relies entirely on mindicador.cl. If their API is unavailable, the app will show error messages.

2. **Data Freshness**: Data is cached for 1 hour. Very recent changes to indicator values may not appear immediately.

3. **Indicator Coverage**: Only indicators provided by mindicador.cl are available. Some specialized financial instruments are not included.
